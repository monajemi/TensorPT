# TensorPT
These are a suit of codes used for studying the Compressed Sensing Phase Transition
of Tensorial measurements. The phase transition experiments have been designed 
by David L. Donoho and Hatef Monajemi at Stanford University. This repository
implements a translation of our MATLAB codes into Python for larger-scale studies.
The Python version is written in collaboration with Jack Poulson and 
uses distributed-memory optmization solver Elemental.
